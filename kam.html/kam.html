        <h2>About Me:</h2>
        <p id="AboutMe ">I am a dedicated information learner that loves opportunities to learn new things and grow as an individual. I have spent the last 5 years growing the healthcare field starting off as a medical assistant and eventually moving into a leadership role with 23 employees. This drive to be better, but also to help others be better is what led me to software development. 

            I have always been good at problem solving and looking at situations from many different analytical standpoints. My experience with fast paced environments that are always revolutionizing has guided me in my career, but also in my education at Tech Elevator. I am excited to find a position as a Junior Developer in any company willing to allow me to work hard for them.</p>
